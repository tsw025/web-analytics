# Test task: Web-application for analyzing Webpages
### Objective
The objective is to build a web application that does an analysis of a web-page/URL.

The application should show a form with a text field in which users can type in the URL of the webpage to be analyzed. Additionally to the form, it should contain a button to send a request to the server.

After processing the results should be shown to the user.

Results should contain next information:

 - What HTML version has the document?
 - What is the page title?
 - How many headings of what level are in the document?
 - How many internal and external links are in the document? Are there any inaccessible links and how many?
 - Does the page contain a login form? 
 
In case the URL given by the user is not reachable an error message should be presented to a user. The message should contain the HTTP status code and a useful error description.


### Restrictions

The application must be put under git control
